/*
Thought process:
- The age groups were chosen based on general classifications, but itâ€™s best to confirm with a doctor.
- Are these ranges clinically meaningful? Should "senior" be further divided (e.g., 65-80 vs. 80+)?
- If this data is used for medical purposes, should we align it with standard medical age brackets (e.g., pediatric, geriatric)?
- Leaving the ranges flexible for adjustment based on expert input.
