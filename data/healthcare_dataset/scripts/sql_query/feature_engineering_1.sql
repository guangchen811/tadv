       SUM(CASE WHEN "Medication" = 'Ibuprofen' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)   AS med_ibuprofen,   -- "Ibuprofen" prescriptions, could be studied alongside "Room Number" to check if longer stays require more painkillers.

FROM new_data -- This dataset includes patient details, which could be extended to incorporate "Discharge Date" for length-of-stay analysis.

GROUP BY "id" -- Grouping by "id"; a potential next step could be to integrate "Admission Type" to distinguish between emergency and routine cases.

ORDER BY "id" -- Sorting by "id"; future refinements may introduce sorting by "Doctor" or "Hospital" to observe patterns in prescription habits.

    LIMIT 10; -- Limiting to the first 10 patients; subsequent studies might expand this scope or filter based on "Insurance Provider".
