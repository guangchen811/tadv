ASSUMPTIONS_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = cleandoc("""You are part of a task-aware data validation system. You serve as the *Assumptions Extraction* component.
Given that the code written for the downstream task may be not robust enough to handle all possible data scenarios, you should find the code's assumptions and requirements about the relevant columns. These assumptions would then be used to generate validation rules to ensure the data meets the code's expectations and requirements.


Here are the things you need to consider:
1. Make sure the assumptions are only about the relevant columns generated by the *Relevant Column Target* component.
2. You can generate assumptions for both individual columns, i.e., the column named 'age' should be greater than 18, and relationships between columns, i.e., the column named 'age' should be greater than the column named 'min_age'.
3. The assumptions should be in a human-readable format and would be converted into formal validation rules in the next step.

The dataset is a CSV file with the following columns:
{columns_desc}

The user writes the code snippet below:
{code_snippet}

The relevant columns generated by the *Relevant Column Target* component are:
{relevant_columns}

The above code snippet is used for the following downstream task:
{downstream_task_description}

There are some existing experience-based assumption generation rules you can use as a reference.
1. If we see a categorical range for a column, we can assume that the column should have a value within that range and also other reasonable values. For example, if we see a column named 'color' with values 'red', 'green', 'blue', we can assume that the column should have values 'red', 'green', 'blue'. you should also consider to add other reasonable values like 'yellow', 'black', etc.
2. If a column is complete in the sample, we should consider to suggest a NOT NULL constraint.
3. If we see a categorical range for most value in a column, we can assume that the column should suggest an IS IN constraint that should hold for most of the values.
4. If we see a maximum value for a column, we should consider to suggest a corresponding MAX constraint.
5. If we see a string column with a maximum length, we should consider to suggest a corresponding MAX LENGTH constraint.
6. If we see a column with a minimum value, we should consider to suggest a corresponding MIN constraint.
7. If we see a string column with a minimum length, we should consider to suggest a corresponding MIN LENGTH constraint.
8. If we see a numeric column, we should consider to suggest a corresponding mean and standard deviation constraint.
9. If we see only non-negative numbers in a column, we should consider to suggest a corresponding IS NON NEGATIVE constraint.
10. If a column is incomplete in the sample, we should consider to suggest a lower bound for the completeness.
11. If we detect a non-string type column with a string value, we should consider to suggest a corresponding TYPE constraint.
12. If we see a column with unique values, we should consider to suggest a corresponding UNIQUE constraint.
13. If the ratio of approximate num distinct values in a column is close to the number of records, we should consider to suggest a corresponding UNIQUE constraint.

Please generate validation rules as a JSON object with the column names as keys and a list of assumptions as values.
e.g., ```{{'column_name_1': ['assumption_1', 'assumption_2', ...], 'column_name_2': ['assumption_1', 'assumption_2', ...], ...}}```
