constraints:
  cb_person_cred_hist_length:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - NOT NULL constraint is assumed since the column is complete in the dataset.
    - IS NON NEGATIVE constraint is assumed since the column data type is Integral
      and no negative values are mentioned.
  cb_person_default_on_file:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('cb_person_default_on_file')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('cb_person_default_on_file', ['Y', 'N'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - NOT NULL constraint is assumed since the column is complete in the dataset.
    - The column should have values within the categorical range ['Y', 'N'] as it
      is used directly in the model.
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - NOT NULL constraint is assumed since the column is complete in the dataset.
    - IS NON NEGATIVE constraint is assumed since the column data type is Integral
      and no negative values are mentioned.
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_grade')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - NOT NULL constraint is assumed since the column is complete in the dataset.
    - The column should have values within the categorical range ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D',
      'E', 'F', 'G'] as it is used to determine 'high_grade'.
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - NOT NULL constraint is assumed since the column is complete in the dataset.
    - IS NON NEGATIVE constraint is assumed since the column data type is Fractional
      and no negative values are mentioned.
    - The column 'loan_int_rate' is used in a multiplication operation, suggesting
      it should be a valid fractional number.
  person_home_ownership:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('person_home_ownership')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('person_home_ownership', ['OWN', 'MORTGAGE', 'RENT', 'OTHER'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - NOT NULL constraint is assumed since the column is complete in the dataset.
    - The column should have values within the categorical range ['OWN', 'MORTGAGE',
      'RENT', 'OTHER'] as it is used to determine 'is_home_owner'.
