constraints:
  cb_person_default_on_file:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('cb_person_default_on_file', ['Y', 'N'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_default_on_file should be one of the distinct values ['Y', 'N'] as
      it is one-hot encoded for categorical processing.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - id should be a unique integer value for each row to correctly map predictions
      with the test data in the submission file.
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be a non-negative integer because it is used with np.log1p,
      which expects non-negative values.
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_grade should be one of the distinct values ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F',
      'G'] as it is one-hot encoded for categorical processing.
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_int_rate should be a non-negative fractional number, as it is used as a
      numerical feature in the model.
