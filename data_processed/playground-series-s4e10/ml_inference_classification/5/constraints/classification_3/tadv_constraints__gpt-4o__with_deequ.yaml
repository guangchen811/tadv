constraints:
  cb_person_cred_hist_length:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Credit history length should be non-negative as negative lengths are not logical.
    - Credit history length should be a reasonable positive integer.
  cb_person_default_on_file:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('cb_person_default_on_file', ['Y', 'N'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Default on file status should be one of ['Y', 'N'] as these are the expected
      indicators.
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - '.hasMin(''loan_amnt'', lambda x: x > 0)'
      - Valid
    - - .isPositive('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Loan amount should be non-negative as negative loan amounts are not logical.
    - Loan amount should be greater than zero to avoid division by zero in income-to-loan
      ratio calculations.
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Loan grade should be one of ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'] as these are
      the expected categories.
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - '.hasMax(''loan_int_rate'', lambda x: x <= 100)'
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Interest rate should be non-negative as negative interest rates are typically
      not handled.
    - Interest rate should be a reasonable value within a certain range, e.g., between
      0% and 100%.
  loan_percent_income:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_percent_income')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Loan percent income should be non-negative as negative percentages do not make
      sense.
    - Loan percent income should be a reasonable percentage, reflecting realistic
      financial ratios.
  person_age:
    code:
    - - '.hasMin(''person_age'', lambda x: x >= 18)'
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('person_age')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Age should be greater than or equal to 18 as it is generally assumed that loans
      are not issued to minors.
    - Age should be non-negative.
  person_emp_length:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('person_emp_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Employment length should be non-negative as negative employment length is not
      logical.
    - Employment length should be a reasonable positive number, potentially capped
      at a certain value representing maximum working age.
  person_home_ownership:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('person_home_ownership', ['RENT', 'MORTGAGE', 'OWN', 'OTHER'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Home ownership status should be one of ['RENT', 'MORTGAGE', 'OWN', 'OTHER']
      as these are the expected categories.
  person_income:
    code:
    - - '.hasMin(''person_income'', lambda x: x > 0)'
      - Valid
    - - .isPositive('person_income')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Income should be non-negative as negative income does not make sense in this
      context.
    - Income should be greater than zero to avoid division by zero errors in income-to-loan
      ratio calculations.
