constraints:
  cb_person_default_on_file:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('cb_person_default_on_file')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('cb_person_default_on_file', ['Y', 'N'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_default_on_file should be either 'Y' or 'N' as these are the only
      valid categories.
    - cb_person_default_on_file should be complete as it's used in the model preprocessing.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('id')
      - Valid
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - id should be unique as it serves as an identifier for each record.
    - id should be non-negative since it is an identifier.
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be non-negative since it's used to calculate the logarithm.
    - loan_amnt should be complete because it's used to compute log_loan_amnt.
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_grade')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_grade should be one of ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'] since these
      are the expected categories.
    - loan_grade should be complete because it's used in the model preprocessing.
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_int_rate should be non-negative as it represents an interest rate.
    - loan_int_rate should be complete as it is part of the numerical features for
      the model.
