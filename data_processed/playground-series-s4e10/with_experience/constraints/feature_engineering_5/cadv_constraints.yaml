constraints:
  cb_person_cred_hist_length:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column should not have null values as it is complete in the sample.
    - The column should have non-negative values as no negative values are expected
      for credit history length.
    - The column should be of Integral data type as inferred from the data type statistics.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('id')
      - Valid
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column should not have null values as it is complete in the sample.
    - The column should have unique values as the ratio of approximate distinct values
      is close to the number of records.
    - The column should be of Integral data type as inferred from the data type statistics.
