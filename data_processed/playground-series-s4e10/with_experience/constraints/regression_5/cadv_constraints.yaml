constraints:
  cb_person_cred_hist_length:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_cred_hist_length should be non-negative, as it is used in a division.
  cb_person_default_on_file:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('cb_person_default_on_file', ['Y', 'N'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_default_on_file should be one of ['Y', 'N'], based on the categorical
      values present.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - id should be unique, as it is used to identify individual records.
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    - - .isPositive('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be greater than 0, as it is used in a division.
    - loan_amnt should be non-negative, as it is used in calculations for feature
      engineering.
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_grade should be one of ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'], based on the
      categorical values present.
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_int_rate should be non-negative, as it is used in a multiplication.
  loan_percent_income:
    code:
    - - .isPositive('loan_percent_income')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - loan_percent_income should be greater than 0, as it is used as a divisor in
      a division. This prevents division by zero.
  person_emp_length:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('person_emp_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - person_emp_length should be non-negative, as it is used in a division.
  person_home_ownership:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('person_home_ownership', ['RENT', 'MORTGAGE', 'OWN', 'OTHER'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - person_home_ownership should be one of ['RENT', 'MORTGAGE', 'OWN', 'OTHER'],
      based on the categorical values present.
  person_income:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('person_income')
      - Valid
    - - .isPositive('person_income')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - person_income should be greater than 0, as it is used as a divisor in a division.
    - person_income should be non-negative, as it is used in calculations for feature
      engineering.
