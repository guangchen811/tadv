constraints:
  cb_person_default_on_file:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('cb_person_default_on_file')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('cb_person_default_on_file', ['Y', 'N'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_default_on_file should only contain the string values 'Y' or 'N',
      as it is used in one-hot encoding.
    - cb_person_default_on_file should not contain missing values, as it is directly
      used for one-hot encoding.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - id should be unique for each row in the test dataset, as it is used to identify
      predictions in the submission file.
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    - - .isPositive('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be a positive integer, as it is used in the logarithm transformation.
    - loan_amnt is expected to have a valid numerical value for the log transformation
      without causing errors.
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_grade')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_grade should only contain expected string values (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)
      as it is used in one-hot encoding.
    - loan_grade should not contain missing values, as it is directly used for one-hot
      encoding.
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_int_rate should be a numerical value, as it is used in numerical transformations
      with StandardScaler.
