constraints:
  person_emp_length:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('person_emp_length')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('person_emp_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The value should be a numeric type, as it is compared with numeric thresholds.
    - The value should not be negative, as employment length represents a duration
      of time.
    - The value should allow comparisons using the operators <, >, and BETWEEN, indicating
      it should be a real number.
