constraints:
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_grade')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column 'loan_grade' should have no missing values, as the SQL query assumes
      the completeness of this column.
    - 'The column ''loan_grade'' should only contain the distinct values: [''A'',
      ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F'', ''G''], as these are the expected categories
      used in the downstream analysis.'
    - The data type of 'loan_grade' should be String, matching the expected format
      for grouping in the SQL query.
