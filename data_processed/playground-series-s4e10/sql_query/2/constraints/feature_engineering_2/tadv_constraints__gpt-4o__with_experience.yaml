constraints:
  person_emp_length:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('person_emp_length')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('person_emp_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column person_emp_length should be complete and have a NOT NULL constraint,
      as it is complete in the sample.
    - 'The column person_emp_length should have a value within the ranges: ''< 2'',
      ''2 to 5'', ''> 5'', or ''Unknown''. This implies handling potential NULL or
      missing values by categorizing them as ''Unknown''.'
    - The column person_emp_length should have non-negative values as the employment
      length cannot be negative in a practical scenario.
