constraints:
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('loan_amnt % 1 == 0', 'loan_amnt_is_integral')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The 'loan_amnt' column should be complete, meaning there should be no missing
      values.
    - The 'loan_amnt' column should contain only non-negative values, as negative
      loan amounts do not make sense in the context of a loan.
    - The 'loan_amnt' should be a valid integral value, as it represents a monetary
      amount and should not have fractional values.
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('loan_int_rate >= 0', 'loan_int_rate_is_fractional')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The 'loan_int_rate' column should be complete, meaning there should be no missing
      values.
    - The 'loan_int_rate' column should contain only non-negative values, as negative
      interest rates are not realistic in this context.
    - The 'loan_int_rate' should be a valid fractional value, as interest rates can
      have decimal points.
