constraints:
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - '.hasNumberOfDistinctValues(''loan_grade'', lambda x: x == 7, None, None)'
      - Valid
    - - .isComplete('loan_grade')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column should not contain null values since completeness is 1.0.
    - The column is expected to have a limited set of distinct values, approximately
      7, representing different loan grades such as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.
    - The column's data type should be String as indicated by the data statistics.
