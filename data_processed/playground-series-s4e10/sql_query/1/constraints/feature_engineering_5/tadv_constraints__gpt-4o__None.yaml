constraints:
  cb_person_cred_hist_length:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_cred_hist_length should be of data type Integral, as it is used in
      arithmetic operations.
    - cb_person_cred_hist_length should be complete, meaning it should not have any
      missing values, as it is used to calculate credit_hist_change.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('id')
      - Valid
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - id should be unique or at least ordered correctly to ensure the LAG function
      works as expected.
    - id should be of data type Integral, as it is used for ordering in the window
      function.
