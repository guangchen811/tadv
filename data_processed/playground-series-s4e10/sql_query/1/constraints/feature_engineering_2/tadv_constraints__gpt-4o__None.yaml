constraints:
  person_age:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('person_age')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('person_age')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - person_age is not directly used in the employment length categorization, but
      its completeness is important for any future analysis.
    - person_age should be greater than or equal to 0, as negative ages are not logical.
  person_emp_length:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('person_emp_length')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('person_emp_length')
      - Valid
    - - .isPositive('person_emp_length')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - person_emp_length should be greater than or equal to 0, as negative employment
      lengths are not logical.
    - person_emp_length should be a positive fractional number, reflecting years of
      experience.
    - person_emp_length should not be NULL, as the code handles potential NULL or
      missing values by categorizing them as 'Unknown'.
