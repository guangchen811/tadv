constraints:
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Column 'loan_amnt' should be complete (NOT NULL).
    - Column 'loan_amnt' should have a minimum value constraint, but specific value
      is not provided.
    - Column 'loan_amnt' should have a maximum value constraint, but specific value
      is not provided.
    - Column 'loan_amnt' should have a mean and standard deviation constraint, but
      specific values are not provided.
    - Column 'loan_amnt' consists of non-negative numbers, suggesting an IS NON NEGATIVE
      constraint.

    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Column 'loan_int_rate' should be complete (NOT NULL).

      NEGATIVE constraint.
  loan_status:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_status')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_status', [0, 1])
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - Column 'loan_status' should be complete (NOT NULL).
    - Column 'loan_status' should be an integral type constraint as it is used in
      numerical calculations.
    - Column 'loan_status' should consist of values within {0, 1}, suggesting an IS
      IN constraint.
