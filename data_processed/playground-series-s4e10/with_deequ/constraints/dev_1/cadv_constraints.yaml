constraints:
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - '.hasPattern(''loan_grade'', ''A|B|C|D'', lambda x: x > 0.5)'
      - Valid
    - - .isComplete('loan_grade')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column 'loan_grade' should be complete, meaning it must not contain any
      null or missing values.
    - 'The column ''loan_grade'' should only contain the values: ''A'', ''B'', ''C'',
      ''D'', ''E'', ''F'', ''G'' as these are the expected loan grades.'
    - The value distribution in 'loan_grade' should largely conform to the historical
      distribution observed, ensuring no drastic shifts that could affect the count
      by grade analysis. For example, the sum of ratios of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'
      should be significantly high, reflecting the majority of the data.
