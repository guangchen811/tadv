constraints:
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column should be complete with no missing values.
    - Loan amounts should be non-negative, as negative loan amounts do not make logical
      sense.
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column should be complete with no missing values.
    - Interest rates should be non-negative, as negative interest rates are not typical
      in financial datasets.
  loan_status:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_status')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_status', [0, 1])
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The column should be complete with no missing values.
    - Loan status values should be either '0' or '1', where '0' typically indicates
      a non-defaulted loan and '1' indicates a defaulted loan.
  person_home_ownership:
    code:
    - - '.hasPattern(''person_home_ownership'', ''RENT|MORTGAGE'', lambda x: x >=
        0.5)'
      - Valid
    - - .isComplete('person_home_ownership')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('person_home_ownership', ['RENT', 'MORTGAGE', 'OWN', 'OTHER'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column should be complete with no missing values.
    - Values should be contained within the set ['RENT', 'MORTGAGE', 'OWN', 'OTHER'].
    - The majority of values are expected to be 'RENT' or 'MORTGAGE', given the distribution.
