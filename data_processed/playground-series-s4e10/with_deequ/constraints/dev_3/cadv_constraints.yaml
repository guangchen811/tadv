    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    - - .isPositive('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be a non-negative integer

    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_int_rate should be a non-negative fractional number
    - loan_int_rate should be within a typical range for interest rates, between 0
      and 100
