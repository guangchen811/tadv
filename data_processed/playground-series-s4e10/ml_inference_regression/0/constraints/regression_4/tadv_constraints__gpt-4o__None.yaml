constraints:
  cb_person_cred_hist_length:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_cred_hist_length should be non-negative since it is used in the calculation
      of cred_hist_ratio.
  cb_person_default_on_file:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('cb_person_default_on_file', ['Y', 'N'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_default_on_file should be one of ['Y', 'N'] since it is used as a
      categorical feature in the model.
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - '.isGreaterThan(''loan_amnt'', ''0'', lambda x: x > 0)'
      - Invalid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be non-negative since it is used for log transformation in
      log_loan_amnt.
    - loan_amnt should be greater than 0 since it is used in division to calculate
      cred_hist_ratio.
    - loan_amnt should be greater than 0 since it is multiplied with loan_int_rate
      in loan_amnt_int_rate.
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_grade should be one of ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'] since it is
      used to determine high_grade.
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_int_rate should be non-negative since it is multiplied with loan_amnt in
      loan_amnt_int_rate.
  person_home_ownership:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('person_home_ownership', ['OWN', 'MORTGAGE', 'RENT', 'OTHER'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - person_home_ownership should be one of ['OWN', 'MORTGAGE', 'RENT', 'OTHER']
      since it is used to determine is_home_owner.
