constraints:
  cb_person_cred_hist_length:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_cred_hist_length should be complete, as it is used in ratio computation.
    - cb_person_cred_hist_length should be non-negative, as it is used as a numerator
      in a ratio calculation which assumes non-negativity.
  cb_person_default_on_file:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('cb_person_default_on_file')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('cb_person_default_on_file', ['N', 'Y'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_default_on_file should be complete, as it is used as a categorical
      feature for model training.
    - cb_person_default_on_file should be one of ['N', 'Y'], as these are the expected
      default status values.
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be complete, as it is used in calculations for log transformation
      and ratio computation.
    - loan_amnt should be non-negative, as it is used in a logarithmic transformation
      which requires positive values.
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_grade')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_grade should be complete, as it is used as a categorical feature for model
      training.
    - loan_grade should be one of ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'], as these are
      the expected grades.
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_int_rate should be complete, as it is directly used as a feature for model
      training.
    - loan_int_rate should be non-negative, as negative interest rates are typically
      not valid within this context.
  person_home_ownership:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('person_home_ownership')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('person_home_ownership', ['RENT', 'MORTGAGE', 'OWN', 'OTHER'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - person_home_ownership should be complete, as it is used as a categorical feature
      for model training.
    - person_home_ownership should be one of ['RENT', 'MORTGAGE', 'OWN', 'OTHER'],
      as these are the expected home ownership statuses.
