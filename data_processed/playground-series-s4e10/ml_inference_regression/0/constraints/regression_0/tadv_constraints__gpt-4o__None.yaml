constraints:
  cb_person_cred_hist_length:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_cred_hist_length should be greater than or equal to 0 as it represents
      a length.
  cb_person_default_on_file:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('cb_person_default_on_file', ['Y', 'N'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - 'cb_person_default_on_file should be one of the expected categories: [''Y'',
      ''N''].'
  cred_hist_ratio:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be greater than or equal to 0 to avoid division by zero in
      cred_hist_ratio calculation.
    - cb_person_cred_hist_length should be greater than or equal to 0 as it represents
      a length.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - id should be unique across the dataset to correctly map predictions back to
      each entry.
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be greater than or equal to 0 as it represents an amount.
  loan_amnt_int_rate:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be greater than or equal to 0 as it represents an amount.
    - loan_int_rate should be greater than or equal to 0 as it represents an interest
      rate.
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - 'loan_grade should be one of the expected categories: [''A'', ''B'', ''C'',
      ''D'', ''E'', ''F'', ''G''].'
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_int_rate should be greater than or equal to 0 as it represents an interest
      rate.
  log_loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be greater than or equal to 0 to ensure the logarithm is well-defined.
  person_home_ownership:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('person_home_ownership', ['OWN', 'MORTGAGE', 'RENT', 'OTHER'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - 'person_home_ownership should be one of the expected categories: [''OWN'', ''MORTGAGE'',
      ''RENT'', ''OTHER''].'
