constraints:
  Date of Admission:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Date of Admission')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('CAST(`Date of Admission` AS DATE) IS NOT NULL', 'Date format and
        convertibility check')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column should be of type DATE or should be convertible to DATE format.
    - The column should not contain any null values, as completeness is 1.0.
    - The column should have consistent date formats to ensure successful conversion.
