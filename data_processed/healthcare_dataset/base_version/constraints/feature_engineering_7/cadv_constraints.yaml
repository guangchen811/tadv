constraints:
  Date of Admission:
    code:
    - - .isComplete("Date of Admission")
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies("CAST(Date of Admission AS DATE) IS NOT NULL", "Date of Admission
        should be convertible to date")
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The 'Date of Admission' column should be convertible to a valid date format
      to ensure the CAST operation succeeds.
    - The 'Date of Admission' column should not have null values as it is essential
      for calculating the 30-day admission window.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isUnique("id")
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The 'id' column should contain unique identifiers for each record to ensure
      accurate partitioning and counting operations.
