      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Must be a numeric value as it is converted to numeric using pd.to_numeric.
    - Missing values are filled with 0.
  Room Number:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Room Number')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('Room Number >= 0', 'Room Number should be non-negative')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - Must be a numeric value as it is converted to numeric using pd.to_numeric.
    - Missing values are filled with 0.
  billing_amount:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('billing_amount')
      - Invalid
    - - .satisfies('billing_amount >= 0', 'Billing Amount should be non-negative')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - Must be a numeric value since it is the target for regression.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('id')
      - Valid
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('id >= 0', 'ID should be non-negative')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Must be a unique identifier since it is used to match test predictions with
      test data.
    - Must be integral as it is treated as an ID column.
