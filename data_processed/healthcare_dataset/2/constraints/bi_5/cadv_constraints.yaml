constraints:
  Billing Amount:
    code:
    - - '.hasMean(''Billing Amount'', lambda x: True)'
      - Valid
    - - '.hasStandardDeviation(''Billing Amount'', lambda x: True)'
      - Valid
    - - .isComplete('Billing Amount')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('Billing Amount')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - Column 'Billing Amount' should be NOT NULL as its completeness is 1.0.
    - Column 'Billing Amount' is expected to be non-negative as it represents billing
      amounts.
    - Column 'Billing Amount' should have a mean and standard deviation constraint
      due to its numeric nature.
  Doctor:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Doctor')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Column 'Doctor' should be NOT NULL as its completeness is 1.0.
