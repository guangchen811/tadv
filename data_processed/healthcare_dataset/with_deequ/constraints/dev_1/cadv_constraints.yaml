constraints:
  Date of Admission:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Date of Admission')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('CAST(`Date of Admission` AS DATE) IS NOT NULL', 'Date of Admission
        should be a valid date')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('`Date of Admission` = LEAD(`Date of Admission`, 1) OVER (ORDER
        BY `Date of Admission` ASC) OR LEAD(`Date of Admission`, 1) OVER (ORDER BY
        `Date of Admission` ASC) IS NULL', 'Date of Admission should be in chronological
        order')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The 'Date of Admission' column must be complete, meaning no missing values are
      allowed.
    - The 'Date of Admission' column should be convertible to a date format, ensuring
      valid date entries.
    - The 'Date of Admission' entries should be in chronological order when used in
      the code's window function for calculating the rolling 7-day average.
