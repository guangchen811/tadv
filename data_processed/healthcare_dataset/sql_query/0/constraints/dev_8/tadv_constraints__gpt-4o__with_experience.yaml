constraints:
  Age:
    code:
    - - '.hasMin(''Age'', lambda x: x >= 65)'
      - Invalid
    - - .isComplete('Age')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('Age')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The 'Age' column is complete, so it should have a NOT NULL constraint.
    - The 'Age' column is of integral type and should be non-negative, suggesting
      a NON NEGATIVE constraint.
    - The 'Age' column is used in a condition 'Age >= 65', suggesting a MIN constraint
      of 65 might be relevant for the specific context of high-risk assessment.
  Medical Condition:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Medical Condition')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('Medical Condition', ['Hypertension', 'Cancer', 'Obesity',
        'Arthritis', 'Diabetes', 'Asthma'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The 'Medical Condition' column is complete, so it should have a NOT NULL constraint.
    - 'The ''Medical Condition'' column has a categorical range of values: ''Hypertension'',
      ''Cancer'', ''Obesity'', ''Arthritis'', ''Diabetes'', ''Asthma''. It should
      have an IS IN constraint for these values, and possibly allow for future known
      conditions.'
  Name:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Name')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The 'Name' column is complete, so it should have a NOT NULL constraint.
    - The 'Name' column is of string type, and while no specific maximum length is
      provided, a reasonable maximum length constraint might be beneficial.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('id')
      - Valid
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The 'id' column is complete, so it should have a NOT NULL constraint.
    - The 'id' column has a high number of distinct values, suggesting it may be a
      unique identifier. Thus, a UNIQUE constraint is appropriate.
