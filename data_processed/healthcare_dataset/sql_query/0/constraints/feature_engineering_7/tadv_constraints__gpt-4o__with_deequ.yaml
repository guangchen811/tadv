constraints:
  Date of Admission:
    code:
    - - .hasPattern('Date of Admission', '\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}')
      - Valid
    - - .isComplete('Date of Admission')

      date calculations can be performed.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('id')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('id')
      - Valid
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The 'id' column should be complete, meaning no missing values are allowed.
