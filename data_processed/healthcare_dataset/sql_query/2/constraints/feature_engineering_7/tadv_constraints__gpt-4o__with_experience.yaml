constraints:
  Date of Admission:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Date of Admission')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('CAST(Date of Admission AS DATE) IS NOT NULL', 'Valid Date Format')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The column 'Date of Admission' should be complete, as it is used to calculate
      the admission_date and determine the 30-day rolling window.
    - The column 'Date of Admission' should be convertible to a valid date format,
      as the code casts it to DATE for calculations.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column 'id' should have unique values, as the approximate number of distinct
      values is close to the total number of records and it is used to identify individual
      records.
