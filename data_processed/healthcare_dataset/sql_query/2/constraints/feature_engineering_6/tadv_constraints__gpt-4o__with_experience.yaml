constraints:
  Date of Admission:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Date of Admission')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('CAST(Date of Admission AS DATE) IS NOT NULL', 'check_date_conversion')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The 'Date of Admission' column is complete, so it should have a NOT NULL constraint.
    - The 'Date of Admission' column is a string that represents dates, so it should
      be convertible to a DATE type without errors.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('id')
      - Valid
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The 'id' column is complete, so it should have a NOT NULL constraint.
    - The 'id' column has a high number of distinct values relative to the number
      of records, indicating it should have a UNIQUE constraint.
