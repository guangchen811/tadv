    assumptions:
    - The 'Date of Admission' column should be complete (no missing values).
    - The 'Date of Admission' values should be in a format that can be converted to
      DATE type.
    - The 'Date of Admission' values should be in chronological order to ensure meaningful
      rolling average calculations.
    - The 'Date of Admission' should fall within a reasonable date range, not in the
      future or too far in the past.
