constraints:
  Date of Admission:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Date of Admission')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('CAST(`Date of Admission` AS DATE) IS NOT NULL', 'Date of Admission
        should be convertible to DATE')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column 'Date of Admission' should have a NOT NULL constraint since its completeness
      is 1.0.
    - The column 'Date of Admission' should be convertible to DATE type as it is used
      in a CAST operation in the code.
