  Name:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Name')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('Name == Name.astype(str)', 'Name should be string')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The column 'Name' should not have any null values since it is used to drop rows
      with missing values.
    - The column 'Name' should be treated as a string type as it is explicitly converted
      to a string in the code.
