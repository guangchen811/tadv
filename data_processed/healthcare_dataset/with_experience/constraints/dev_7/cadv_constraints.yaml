constraints:
  Date of Admission:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Date of Admission')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('CAST(Date of Admission AS DATE) IS NOT NULL', 'Date of Admission
        should be convertible to DATE')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The column 'Date of Admission' should have a NOT NULL constraint as it is complete
      in the sample.
    - The column 'Date of Admission' should be convertible to a DATE type, as it is
      used in a CAST operation in the code.
