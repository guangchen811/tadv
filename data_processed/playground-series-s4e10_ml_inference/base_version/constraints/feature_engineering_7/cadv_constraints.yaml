constraints:
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - '.hasMax(''loan_int_rate'', lambda x: x > 20)'
      - Valid
    - - '.hasMin(''loan_int_rate'', lambda x: x >= 0)'
      - Valid

        > 20', 'loan_int_rate category check')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_int_rate should be a valid fractional number
    - loan_int_rate categorizes into 'Low Rate' if less than 10
    - loan_int_rate categorizes into 'Medium Rate' if between 10 and 20 inclusive
    - loan_int_rate categorizes into 'High Rate' if greater than 20
