constraints:
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isPositive('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be greater than 0, as dividing by zero would cause an error.
    - loan_amnt should be a positive value, as negative loan amounts are not meaningful.
  person_income:
    code:
    - - .isPositive('person_income')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - person_income should be greater than 0, as dividing by zero would cause an error.
    - person_income should be a positive value, as negative income is not realistic.
