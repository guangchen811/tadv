constraints:
  cb_person_cred_hist_length:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('cb_person_cred_hist_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_cred_hist_length should be greater than or equal to 0 to ensure cred_hist_ratio
      calculation is valid.
  cb_person_default_on_file:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('cb_person_default_on_file', ['Y', 'N'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - cb_person_default_on_file should be one of ['Y', 'N'] for OneHotEncoder transformation.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - id should be unique to ensure correct identification of each entry in the submission.
  loan_amnt:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_amnt')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_amnt should be greater than or equal to 0 to ensure log transformation
      is valid.
    - loan_amnt should be greater than or equal to 0 to avoid division by zero in
      cred_hist_ratio and loan_to_income calculations.
  loan_grade:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('loan_grade', ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - 'loan_grade should be one of the known categories: [''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'',
      ''E'', ''F'', ''G''] for OneHotEncoder transformation.'
  loan_int_rate:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('loan_int_rate')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - loan_int_rate should be greater than or equal to 0 to ensure loan_amnt_int_rate
      calculation is valid.
  loan_percent_income:
    code:
    - - .isPositive('loan_percent_income')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - loan_percent_income should be greater than 0 to avoid division by zero in emp_length_income_ratio
      calculation.
  person_emp_length:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('person_emp_length')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - person_emp_length should be greater than or equal to 0 to ensure emp_length_income_ratio
      calculation is valid.
  person_home_ownership:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('person_home_ownership', ['OWN', 'MORTGAGE', 'RENT', 'OTHER'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - person_home_ownership should be one of ['OWN', 'MORTGAGE', 'RENT', 'OTHER']
      for OneHotEncoder transformation.
  person_income:
    code:
    - - .isNonNegative('person_income')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - person_income should be greater than or equal to 0 to avoid division by zero
      in loan_to_income calculation.
