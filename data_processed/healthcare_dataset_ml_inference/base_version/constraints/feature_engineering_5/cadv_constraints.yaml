constraints:
  I cannot accurately determine the relevant columns used by the downstream task.:
    code: []
    assumptions: []
  ? I would need to analyze the provided SQL code snippet to determine which columns
    from the dataset are used in the query. However
  : code: []
    assumptions: []
  I'd be able to assist further.:
    code: []
    assumptions: []
  If you can provide the missing SQL code snippet:
    code: []
    assumptions: []
  To identify the relevant columns:
    code: []
    assumptions: []
  it seems that the code snippet is missing from the prompt. Without the code snippet:
    code: []
    assumptions: []
