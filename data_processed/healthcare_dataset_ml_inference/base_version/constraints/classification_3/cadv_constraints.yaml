constraints:
  Age:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Age')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('Age')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Age should be a numeric (integral) value since it is used in scaling operations.
    - Age should be non-negative, as negative ages are not valid.
  Billing Amount:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Billing Amount')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('Billing Amount')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - Billing Amount should be a numeric (fractional) value since it is used in scaling
      operations.
    - Billing Amount should be non-negative, as negative billing amounts are not valid.
  Gender:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Gender')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('Gender', ['Male', 'Female'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Gender should only contain the categories 'Male' and 'Female' as these are the
      expected categories for one-hot encoding.
  Medical Condition:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Medical Condition')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('Medical Condition', ['Hypertension', 'Cancer', 'Obesity',
        'Arthritis', 'Diabetes', 'Asthma'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - Medical Condition should only contain predefined categories based on the histogram,
      which are 'Hypertension', 'Cancer', 'Obesity', 'Arthritis', 'Diabetes', and
      'Asthma'.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('id')
      - Valid
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - id should be a unique numeric (integral) value for each record since it is used
      for identifying records.
