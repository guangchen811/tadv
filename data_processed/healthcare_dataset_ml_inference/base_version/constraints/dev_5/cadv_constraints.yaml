constraints:
  Billing Amount:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Billing Amount')
      - Valid
    - - .isNonNegative('Billing Amount')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The 'Billing Amount' column should be of type Fractional and should not contain
      null values, as its completeness is 1.0.
    - The 'Billing Amount' column values should be non-negative, assuming billing
      amounts cannot be negative in a typical healthcare billing context.
  Medical Condition:
    code:
    - - .isContainedIn('Medical Condition', ['Hypertension', 'Cancer', 'Obesity',
        'Arthritis', 'Diabetes', 'Asthma'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - 'The ''Medical Condition'' column should only contain the following distinct
      values: Hypertension, Cancer, Obesity, Arthritis, Diabetes, and Asthma, as inferred
      from the histogram distribution.'
  Name:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Name')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The 'Name' column should not contain null or empty values, given its completeness
      is 1.0, it is expected to always have a value.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The 'id' column should have unique values, as it is likely used as an identifier
      for each record.
