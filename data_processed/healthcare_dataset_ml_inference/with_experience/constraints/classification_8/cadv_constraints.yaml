constraints:
  Date of Admission:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Date of Admission')
      - Valid
    - - .satisfies('Date of Admission IS NOT NULL AND Date of Admission != ""', 'Parsable
        Date Check')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The 'Date of Admission' column should be parsable as dates, as it is converted
      to datetime.
    - The 'Date of Admission' column should be complete, as it is used in calculating
      'length_of_stay'.
  Discharge Date:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Discharge Date')
      - Valid
    - - .isGreaterThanOrEqualTo('Discharge Date', 'Date of Admission')
      - Invalid
    - - .satisfies('Discharge Date IS NOT NULL AND Discharge Date != ""', 'Parsable
        Date Check')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The 'Discharge Date' column should be parsable as dates, as it is converted
      to datetime.
    - The 'Discharge Date' column should be complete, as it is used in calculating
      'length_of_stay'.
    - The 'Discharge Date' should not be earlier than the 'Date of Admission'.
  Test Results:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('Test Results')
      - Valid
    - - .isContainedIn('Test Results', ['Abnormal', 'Normal', 'Inconclusive'])
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - 'The ''Test Results'' column should only contain values within the predefined
      categories: ''Abnormal'', ''Normal'', ''Inconclusive'', as seen in the histogram.'
    - The 'Test Results' column should be complete, as it is the target variable for
      the machine learning model.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('id')
      - Valid
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The 'id' column should be complete, as it is used to track individual records.
    - The 'id' column should have unique values, as it is used to identify each record
      uniquely.
