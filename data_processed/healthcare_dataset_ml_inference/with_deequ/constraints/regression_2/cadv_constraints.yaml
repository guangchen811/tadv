constraints:
  admission_dt:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('admission_dt')
      - Invalid
    - - .satisfies('admission_dt IS NOT NULL', 'Admission Date should be parseable
        to datetime')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The column 'admission_dt' should be parseable to datetime format, as it is converted
      using pd.to_datetime.
    - The column 'admission_dt' should be complete, meaning it should not contain
      any missing values, since the length_of_stay calculation requires it.
  billing_amount:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('billing_amount')
      - Invalid
    - - .satisfies('billing_amount >= 0', 'Billing Amount should be non-negative')
      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The column 'billing_amount' should be complete, meaning it should not contain
      any missing values.
    - The column 'billing_amount' should contain only numeric values as it is used
      for regression in the neural network model.
  discharge_dt:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('discharge_dt')
      - Invalid
    - - .satisfies('discharge_dt IS NOT NULL', 'Discharge Date should be parseable

      - Invalid
    assumptions:
    - The column 'discharge_dt' should be parseable to datetime format, as it is converted
      using pd.to_datetime.
    - The column 'discharge_dt' should be complete, meaning it should not contain
      any missing values, since the length_of_stay calculation requires it.
  id:
    code:
    - - .isComplete('id')
      - Valid
    - - .isUnique('id')
      - Valid
    assumptions:
    - The column 'id' should be complete, meaning it should not contain any missing
      values, as it is used to uniquely identify records.
    - The column 'id' should contain unique values, ensuring each record can be distinctly
      identified.
